                        <h3>Business Man</h3>
                        <p>Rap based on the everyday life of a business student.</p>
                        <p>Business is my game and I do play.
                            Getting paid dividends to no end.
                            Economical gain everyday with no shame.
                            I have so much money not even the banks could contain.
                            RBC just turned into a RV and drove off with your money in vain.
                            This is my campaign to obtain a special kind of fame.
                            Like a battle between Batman and Wane.
                            Yeah the business world is my domain.
                            In which i'm insane.
                            Doing cocaine to not feel mundane.
                            In my crain whilst i'm eating grain.
                            That was imported from Spain.</p>

                            I don't trust the Gov
                            Always thought I was in Love
                            Until I gave her the shove
                            Now she's letting other guys put on the glove
                            Yeah look at what you made me become
                            I'll make you succumb
                            Like a little bread crumb
                            Yeah my mom made me this numb
                            Narcissistic tendencies inside of me trying to be free
                            Don't try to diagnose me unless you have that degree

                            Like a one-on-one
                            I'll pull out my gun
                            And kill you in-one
                            Yeah homie, don't try to outrun

                        <p>Hook#1
                            I went to the doctors for depression
                            Bitches put me on venlafaxine
                            But I'd rather have a rap-session
                            Because I'm the big boss Giovanni
                            I know our flow is slow
                            But it still leaves our foes in woe
                            
                            Verse#1
                            I am rapping way faster than this beat
                            Yeah it couldn't possibly keep up with me
                            Other rappers say I cheat
                            When they take a backseat to me
                            Indeed, this is my fucking speed
                            It's guaranteed to reach 100 degrees
                            Yeah I'm a new type of breed
                            I was born with a creed
                            To fuck bitches that look like Riley Reid
                            But that shit wasn't free
                            Yeah you could've said she was from Tennessee
                            She was the only 10 I could see
                            But the real key to my knee
                            Is if you agree not to flee
                            Like a cat climbing a tree
                            Or a catfish in the sea
                            Yea it would look kind of funny
                            But I don't get that lucky
                            I just study
                            And if you outrun me bunny
                            Then I'll come at like Chuckie
                            And make you my last key
                            
                            Hook#2

                            But it still leaves our foes in woe
                            
                            Verse#2
                            Yeah imma go all in
                            Baby you my violin
                            And when i see you i get a grin
                            That's why i swim and go to the gym
                            Even though my name isn't Jim Halpert
                            From the albert
                            The berta boys are here
                            We only appear to feed on your fear
                            So lend your ear
                            Yeah because my depression is so severe without you my dear
                            That why the last verse in is your name
                            To tell you I was framed
                            But the truth is that i'm to blame
                            Yeah but i'll never admit to those claims

                            Verse#3
                            Yeah I just took a dose of trazodone
                            And i can say that shit hit me straight to the dome
                            Taking these meds to feel at home
                            Yeah without a show of remorse
                            I am the workhorse
                            That's why i get outsourced
                            In order to enforce
                            And after awhile to reinforce
                            You to stay on course
                            That's why my lyrics warp and contort
                            Like an escort coming over to my resort
                            And maybe i'll sit you down like dahmer
                            But then i'd speak to the honor
                            With everyone looking at me like i'm a bomber
                            With me thinking i'm a goner</p>
